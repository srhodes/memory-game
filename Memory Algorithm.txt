// looking for a way to change background to color

Users should only be able to change at most two cards at a time.
// add restraint of the number of card to hold at the time
// maybe use toggle exercise

When clicking two cards that are not a match, they should stay turned over for at least 1 second before they hide the color again. You should make sure to use a setTimeout so that you c
an execute code after one second.
